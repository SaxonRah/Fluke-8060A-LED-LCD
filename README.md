# Fluke-8060A-LED-LCD
## PCB for the Fluke 8060A's LCD but converted to LED.
### Inspired by Dmitri Faguet, ModemHead, ogdento, JdaleH, retiredcaps, DrTaylor, Dave and everyone else at EEVBlog.
All work was done intermittently through 20/4/2023 - 8/2/2024. Posted for historical and contributional reasons. The original PCB was made and it had 2 errors, layout of digits and missing pin 23.

## Fluke 8060A is simply the best.
This is mostly a KiCAD project for the LED PCB, with some extra photos, PDFs, and various things related to the 8060A.

## Notes
Finalized the Rev 1 PCB. Will do BOM and assembly for PCBWay soon.
