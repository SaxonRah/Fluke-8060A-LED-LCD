# Fluke-8060A-LED-LCD
## PCB for the Fluke 8060A's LCD but converted to LED.
### Inspired by Dmitri Faguet, ModemHead, ogdento, JdaleH, retiredcaps, DrTaylor, Dave and everyone else at EEVBlog.
All work was done intermittently through 20/4/2023 - 8/2/2024. Posted for historical and contributional reasons. This PCB has never been made, it's only a proof of concept. There are probably errors.

## Fluke 8060A is simply the best.
This is mostly a KiCAD project for the LED PCB, with some extra photos, PDFs, and various things related to the 8060A.

You can load an older version of the KiCAD project in the `Fluke_LCD/Fluke_LCD-backups` folder for non-smoothed traces. There are some obvious issues with the smooth traces in the plugin I used.

You'd have to solder wires from the LED PCB to the actual Fluke mainboard, probably modify the LCD support bracket as well. 

I'd love to create a 3D print of an LED plastic overlay for it as well, similar to Dmitri Faguet's work. The PCB should be finalized first as to reduce the number of 3D print revisions.
